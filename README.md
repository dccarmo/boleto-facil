# Zebra

Eu criei este projeto em 2014 e ele está live na App Store desde então. Agora decidi compartilhar o código aqui no Github.

Descrição do projeto (em inglês):

One day I was browsing through the Brazilian App Store and noticed some “boleto reading” apps ranked among the top grossing. And all of them were ugly and didn’t have an iOS 7 style (at the time). So I decided to create one and see how it fared against them. Now “boleto” can be roughly translated to “invoice”, which you can pay on your computer, phone or at your bank. Since they are a popular method of paying for goods in Brazil, it’s not common to have lots of boletos to pay and sometimes forgetting to pay.

By reading the bar code from the boleto, Zebra can save their due date, amount, type of payment (electric bill, phone bill, government taxes, etc) and present in a user friendly way so the numbers can be copied from the phone or to the computer. The app allows that by creating an web server within itself and returning an IP address for the user to open on her computer browser. Zebra also allows the user to set up alarms and set a boleto as payed.

At first I charged US$0.99 for the app, but the sales weren’t great so I added an in-app purchase and started giving it for free with a 3 boletos limit. With that strategy, the downloads increased, but the revenue didn’t. Even so, I’m really proud with how the app turned out and to know that Zebra is helping someone out there feels really good.
