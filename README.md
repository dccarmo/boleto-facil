# Zebra

Boletos are a popular way to pay for things in Brazil, more commonly used to pay bills (rent, utilities, etc). Zebra is a boleto manager that allows you to scan a barcode and store the boleto in the app, create reminders to pay boletos and also get the boleto information whenever the user needs by opening a link.

This was the first personal project that I developed and released. It didn't attract much interest during launch but nowadays it gets about 10 downloads per day.
